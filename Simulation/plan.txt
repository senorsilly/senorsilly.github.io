1. The Sphere Flake and Universe Representation
A sphere flake is a fractal structure. We can represent this recursively.

Universe object: This will be the fundamental unit.

id: A unique identifier (e.g., a path in the fractal tree).

parent: A reference to the parent Universe.

children: An array of child Universe objects.

physicalConstants: An object containing values for constants like gravity, planckConstant, speedOfLight, etc.

state: An object to hold the current state of the universe, including age and a timeline of events.

stats: An object to hold high-level statistics like numberOfStars, numberOfBlackHoles, numberOfPlanets, numberOfLifeForms.

hydrogenDensity: A function or value representing the rate of hydrogen density increase.

spatialPosition: A 3D vector representing its relative position in the sphere flake.

2. The Timeline
This is crucial for the ability to rewind, fast-forward, and branch.

Timeline object: A structure to hold historical states.

events: An array of Event objects, where an Event has a timestamp and a type (e.g., starFormation, planetFormation, lifeEmergence).

stateSnapshots: An array of snapshots of the Universe object at specific points in time. This is for rewinding to a specific point.

currentTimestamp: The current time in the simulation.

3. Celestial Objects (Stars, Planets, etc.)
These can be represented as objects within the Universe.

CelestialObject object: A base object for all celestial bodies.

id: Unique ID.

type: (e.g., 'star', 'planet', 'nebula').

state: (e.g., 'forming', 'mainSequence', 'supernova').

position: 3D vector.

mass: A value.

age: A value.

composition: A statistical representation of elements.

4. Life and Technology
This will be a more complex object.

LifeForm object:

id: Unique ID.

type: (e.g., 'microbial', 'plant', 'animal').

location: Reference to the Planet object.

timeline: A mini-timeline of the life form's evolution.

awareness: A value representing self-awareness.

technologyLevel: A value representing its technological advancement.

Misc.
Create a new type of celestial object: Maybe something like an asteroid field or a black hole that affects nearby objects.
